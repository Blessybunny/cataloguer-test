CHECKPOINT:
    - StudentController.php (Edit - lock)

                boolean('SAFETY_locker')
                string('SAFETY_editor', 50)

                // find a comfortable place for nihonggo visibility
UTMOST PRIORITY:
    - ISSUE: You can delete yourself while logged in.
        - You must be logged out for anyone to delete you.
            - Make a boolean value to "safety-lock" you while logged in, this goes false when logged out.
            - This boolean will hide the danger zone area in the edit pages.
            - DB_SAFETY_LOCK (boolean)
        - Logout a page when a user doesn't exist (POST methods, maybe GET)
        - Since most permission redirects lead to home, bubble home to log out the user.
    - student lock boolean
    - create a DB_PRESERVE_CREATED for creation.
    - create a DB_PRESERVE_EDITED for editing.
    - pending addition of DB_YEAR_id for Users
        - this property is exclusive to grade level coordinators, advisers, and teachers

The Easy Stuff:
    - Add a toggle button for SF9-10 editor to highlight the backgrounds of editable fields.
    - For every edit page and save action, implement a javascript window prompt to confirm changes.
    - add copyright and current year to footer

PENDING:
    - Look up "Laravel 10 - Pagination"
    - Create print-specific classnames that hide on actual page printing (eg. remedial add button)
    - Re-split page.blade.php's content into dashboard.blade.php in order for login.blade.php to use meta, head, and body format.

            - User manual notes:
                - sections are a sensitive form of data and have to be exlusive to principals.
                - school years are best managed by principals where they are fit to use their role
                  to assign themselves or another into the record. administrators can ask their
                  principal to create legacy school years if ever there are missing records.
                - students are a sensitive form of data and can only be viewd and lock-toggled for
                  this role.
                - users can be modified by the principal, and can exclusively add another principal
                  should one step down from the position.
